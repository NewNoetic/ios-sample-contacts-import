# iOS Sample Contact Generator

This project reads in an included VCF file of generated contacts and stores them in the iOS addressbook.

It's main use is to generate a list of contacts to be used by the iOS Simulator for contacts related testing.

To use: 

* build + install app
* tap buttons to either add contacts or remove contacts from your iOS address book

*Warning: best to only use this when running the app on the simulator.*
